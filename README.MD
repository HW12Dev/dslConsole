# dslConsole

Open source version of a development tool, called wxConsole, used with the Diesel game engine (PAYDAY: The Heist, PAYDAY 2, RAID: World War II)

Currently only works with [Lead and Gold - Gangs of the Wild West](https://store.steampowered.com/app/42120/Lead_and_Gold_Gangs_of_the_Wild_West/),
as that is the only Diesel engine game to be released with the ability to connect to wxConsole.
